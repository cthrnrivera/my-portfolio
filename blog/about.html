          <strong>Claude Monet</strong> (1840 – 1926) was a leading figure of the French
          <em>Impressionist</em> movement and a pioneer of modern painting. He sought to capture
          the ever-changing qualities of light and atmosphere, painting the same subjects at
          different times of day and in varying weather.

          Born in Paris and raised in Le Havre, Monet trained at the Académie Suisse and was
          inspired by nature and outdoor settings (<em>en plein air</em>). His groundbreaking
          1872 painting <em>Impression, Sunrise</em> gave the Impressionist movement its name.
          Later series—such as the <em>Water Lilies</em>, <em>Haystacks</em>, and
          <em>Rouen Cathedral</em>—showcase his fascination with color, light, and reflection.

          Monet spent his later years in Giverny, where his famous garden became both his
          inspiration and subject. Today, his works are celebrated worldwide for their
          vibrancy and innovative brushwork.
